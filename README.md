A simple example to start to see what Meteor, Apollo, and MongoDB looks like.

This is the Meteor version of the examples Jonas' post
[How to build a GraphQL server](https://medium.com/apollo-stack/tutorial-building-a-graphql-server-cddaa023c035#.nbab6cbij)

Navigate to `localhost:3000` if you want to see some fortunes.
